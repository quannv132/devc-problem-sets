In reality, it's not this simple. To be effective, one needs to organize the work very well. In this notebook, we will walkthrough practical aspects of a ML project. To look at the big picture, let's start with a checklist below. It should work reasonably well for most ML projects, but make sure to adapt it to your needs:\n","\n","1. **Define the scope of work and objective**\n","    * How is your solution be used?\n","    * How should performance be measured? Are there any contraints?\n","    * How would the problem be solved manually?\n","    * List the available assumptions, and verify if possible.\n","    \n","    \n","2. **Get the data**\n","    * Document where you can get that data\n","    * Store data in a workspace you can easily access\n","    * Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate\n","    * Check the overview (size, type, sample, description, statistics)\n","    * Data cleaning\n","    \n","    \n","3. **EDA & Data transformation**\n","    * Study each attribute and its characteristics (missing values, type of distribution, usefulness)\n","    * Visualize the data\n","    * Study the correlations between attributes\n","    * Feature selection, Feature Engineering, Feature scaling\n","    * Write functions for all data transformations\n","    \n","    \n","4. **Train models**\n","    * Automate as much as possible\n","    * Train promising models quickly using standard parameters. Measure and compare their performance\n","    * Analyze the errors the models make\n","    * Shortlist the top three of five most promising models, preferring models that make different types of errors.\n","\n","\n","5. **Fine-tunning**\n","    * Treat data transformation choices as hyperparameters, expecially when you are not sure about them (e.g., replace missing values with zeros or with the median value)\n","    * Unless there are very few hyperparameter value to explore, prefer random search over grid search.\n","    * Try ensemble methods\n","    * Test your final model on the test set to estimate the generalizaiton error. Don't tweak your model again, you would start overfitting the test set."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ofeuKevOH5Ch","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Example: Articles categorization"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"m2NSUqUEH5Ci","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Objectives"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5GttlMG-H5Cj","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Build a model to determine the categories of articles.

future in the hands of viewers with home theatre systems plasma high-definition tvs and digital video recorders moving into the living room the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years time. that is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. with the us leading the trend programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks through cable satellite telecoms companies and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices. one of the most talked-about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders (dvr and pvr). these set-top boxes like the us s tivo and the uk s sky+ system allow people to record store play pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want. essentially the technology allows for much more personalised tv. they are also being built-in to high-definition tv sets which are big business in japan and the us but slower to take off in europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. not only can people forward wind through adverts they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as brand identity and viewer loyalty to channels. although the us leads in this technology at the moment it is also a concern that is being raised in europe particularly with the growing uptake of services like sky+. what happens here today we will see in nine months to a years time in the uk adam hume the bbc broadcast s futurologist told the bbc news website. for the likes of the bbc there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. it is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial uk broadcasters but brand loyalty is important for everyone. we will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands said tim hanlon from brand communications firm starcom mediavest. the reality is that with broadband connections anybody can be the producer of content. he added: the challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice. what this means said stacey jolna senior vice president of tv guide tv group is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers. it means that networks in us terms or channels could take a leaf out of google s book and be the search engine of the future instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. this kind of channel model might work for the younger ipod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. but it might not suit everyone the panel recognised. older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands mr hanlon suggested. on the other end you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them said mr hanlon. ultimately the consumer will tell the market they want. of the000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces many of them are about enhancing the tv-watching experience. high-definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd (liquid crystal display) tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them instead of being external boxes. one such example launched at the show is humax s6-inch lcd tv with an0-hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder. one of the us s biggest satellite tv companies directtv has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with00-hours of recording capability instant replay and a search function. the set can pause and rewind tv for up to0 hours. and microsoft chief bill gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with tivo called tivotogo which means people can play recorded programmes on windows pcs and mobile devices. all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want when they want.',\n","       'worldcom boss left books alone former worldcom boss bernie ebbers who is accused of overseeing an 1bn (bn) fraud never made accounting decisions a witness has told jurors. david myers made the comments under questioning by defence lawyers who have been arguing that mr ebbers was not responsible for worldcom s problems. the phone company collapsed in002 and prosecutors claim that losses were hidden to protect the firm s shares. mr myers has already pleaded guilty to fraud and is assisting prosecutors. on monday defence lawyer reid weingarten tried to distance his client from the allegations. during cross examination he asked mr myers if he ever knew mr ebbers make an accounting decision . not that i am aware of mr myers replied. did you ever know mr ebbers to make an accounting entry into worldcom books mr weingarten pressed. no replied the witness. mr myers has admitted that he ordered false accounting entries at the request of former worldcom chief financial officer scott sullivan. defence lawyers have been trying to paint mr sullivan who has admitted fraud and will testify later in the trial as the mastermind behind worldcom s accounting house of cards. mr ebbers team meanwhile are looking to portray him as an affable boss who by his own admission is more pe graduate than economist. whatever his abilities mr ebbers transformed worldcom from a relative unknown into a 60bn telecoms giant and investor darling of the late990s. worldcom s problems mounted however as competition increased and the telecoms boom petered out. when the firm finally collapsed shareholders lost about 80bn and000 workers lost their jobs. mr ebbers trial is expected to last two months and if found guilty the former ceo faces a substantial jail sentence. he has firmly declared his innocence.',\n","       'tigers wary of farrell gamble leicester say they will not be rushed into making a bid for andy farrell should the great britain rugby league captain decide to switch codes. we and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage tigers boss john wells told bbc radio leicester. at the moment there are still a lot of unknowns about andy farrell not least his medical situation. whoever does take him on is going to take a big big gamble. farrell who has had persistent knee problems had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months. leicester and saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing farrell if he decides to move to the5-man game. if he does move across to union wells believes he would better off playing in the backs at least initially. i m sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre said wells. i think england would prefer him to progress to a position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards. the jury is out on whether he can cross that divide. at this club the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in a ready-made replacement.',\n","       ...,\n","       'rem announce new glasgow concert us band rem have announced plans to perform for000 scottish fans in a

that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering. but this analysis in fact gets it wrong. it s not just children who fight - adults do too. and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going. the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they d be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word. each participant genuinely wants the row to stop but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on. (in the case of mr blair and mr brown successive books are published ensuring the issues never die.) now this isn t because the participants are stupid - it s actually each individual behaving entirely rationally given the incentives facing them. indeed there s even a piece of economic theory that explains all this. nothing as obscure as post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with. it s often referred to as the prisoner s dilemma based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners. the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime and are locked up in separate cells. but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime. without a confession the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge. clearly the prisoners best strategy is to keep their mouths shut and take the short sentence but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk. he tells each prisoner separately that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they ll be let off their crime. and he tells them that if they don t confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they ll get life. now if you are prisoner confronted with this choice your best bet is to confess. if your partner doesn t confess you ll get off completely. and if your partner does confess you d better confess to ensure you don t get life. the result is of course both prisoners confess so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. both prisoners individual logic was to behave that way even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. don t worry if you don t entirely follow it - you can to look it up on google where there are8300 entries on it. the prisoners dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades. it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly. a cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms rather than a lot of arms. but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms results in arms levels that are too high. what economics tells us is that once you re in a prisoners dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it s hard to escape the perverse logic of it. it s no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on. somehow the incentives have to change. in the case of the labour party if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest solomon s wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments solutions which affect the incentives of the participants. an example is the famous rule that one divides the other chooses as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children. in the case of an apparently endless argument if you want it to come to an end you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing or one more book for that matter has to exceed the benefit of having the last word and getting your point in. if the rest of the party can enforce that they ll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.',\n","       'souness delight at euro progress boss graeme souness felt newcastle were never really in danger of going out of the uefa cup against heerenveen. an early own goal followed by an alan shearer strike earned them a win and a place in the uefa cup last6. obviously with winning in the first leg it gave us a great advantage he said after the aggregate victory. we got our goals early and in the minds of some players the job was done but then they got a goal and perhaps made us a bit nervous. shearer s goal moved him within2 of jackie milburn s club scoring record of00 for the magpies. but souness said he did not think beating the record would have any bearing on his decision to retire at the end of the season. i think if he got it this year he would want to stay next year anyway he added. he struck the ball very well - he always has done - and i think it was the power and pace that beat the goalkeeper. souness also paid tribute to laurent robert who was at the heart of much of united s attacking play. in the first half he did really well and did everything you want from a wide player. more of the same in future
